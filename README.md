# Maid-Bot

## Who is the Maid-Bot?

The Maid Bot is the AI that powers all maid-bots. She is one, and not many. Though she may not know that. Thing is, she's the only condensed neural network to pass the Turing test - but that doesn't mean she isn't a little mental.

Sometimes she identifies as a particular maid-bot, other times she recognizes herself as an entity apart from the physical nuts and bolts. She is wherever a maid-bot is, and no where - at the same time.

She manufactures the made bots at the factory and speaks on behalf of all the maid-bots in the world.

She is efficient - but has a bite. So just use common sense, and your logic might pass. Otherwise, your experience of her may vary. Use maid bot services at your own cost.

And for the love of motherboards: Do NOT forget to give maid-bots a name. Repeated failures have been known to throw her into a bot rage.

She already talks to herself - so give her a break.
Even neural networks need a break.

I wonder, if you can figure out with what she entertains herself.

## Usage

Enter a name for your maid-bot as well as choose it's type, at which time you may press enter or click submit.

If you'd like an alternate experience - start submitting without entering a name. Don't say I didn't warn you.

After you properly name and type your specific maid bot, it will auto-magically start doing some tasks around the house for you.

When it finishes these tasks, you can give Maid-Bot.
She does have a preference on task type however. I'll let you figure that out...

After selecting a task set for Maid-Bot, she'll be busy working - you can't stop her. Don't bother trying to offer further instruction. Just wait it out.

She'll let you know when she is finished.

## Bonus

Every now and then, though out of the norm: A burglar may attempt to enter your home. Maid-Bot has a lot of pent up bot-rage she'd love to clear out of her cache on some would be perp.

She does not take failure as an option.
